# Example Node Server with Postman

### Getting Started

Let's start our server.
```
$ npm start
```

You should now be able to visit `localhost:4004/todo`

### Watching file changes with `nodemon`

We can improve our `npm start` script with `nodemon`.

```shell
$ npm install --save-dev nodemon
```

Then we'll restart our server.

```shell
$ npm start
```
